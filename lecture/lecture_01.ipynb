    "In these notes matrix rank is recapitulated starting with the definition. Many properties of matrix rank trivially follow from the very first definition, and some are stated here right after the definition. Proving the equivalence of several other definitions of rank requires a general procedure for solving linear equation and eliminating any possible linear dependence along the way. When that procedure is developed in the language of vector spaces, a key result is the Steinitz exchange lemma. When the same is done in the language of matrices, a key result is the existence of the so-called row echelon form (or the reduced row echelon form) of a matrix. The echelon form is a direct analogue of the pivoted LU factorization."
